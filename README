All required features have been implemented. Some notes:

1. Smooth shading is enabled by default on the trimesh models that
   support it, and it cannot be turned off. 

2. cubemaps can be loaded by clicking "file" > "load cubemap" or hitting
   [alt] + [c]. Once a cubemap is loaded, cubemapping cannot be disabled.

3. Antialiasing is controlled via the antialiasing slider. AA is implemented
   using plain old supersampling, and the slider values correspond to the
   square root of the number of samples used per pixel (ie 1 = no AA, 2 = 4x,
   3 = 9x, 4 = 16x).

4. phong illumination uses the blinn-phong model, so specular highlights might
   appear larger than the sample code

5. for acceleration, I used a bounding volume hierarchy that chooses splits
   based on the longest dimension of the current bounding box and then splits
   the current box in half along the chosen dimension. Obviously there are
   more effective acceleration structures, but this method was easy to
   implement and has very little computational overhead.
